## CHIKEN BIRYANI
### The name Biryani is thought to be derived from the Persian word birinj (برنج‎) which means “rice”.
### Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. 
### The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy.
